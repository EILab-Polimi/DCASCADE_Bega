README function folder D-CASCADE Bega case studyThe function folder contains the most important scripts and function used in the paper; divided into three folders:

- Folder DCASCADE_historicsim contains the script script_DCASCADEBega_historicsim, with all the operations to simulate historic sediment (dis)connectivity trajectories on the Bega river network for the different hydrological scenarios, and the function DCASCADEmodel_Bega, which is the main D-CASCADE function. It contains all the main step constituting the D-CASCADE model described in the paper, as well as the model add-ons. This version of the model is specifically designed for the Bega river network case study, and includes specifications of the model temporal steps and other simulations parameters described in the paper;

- Folder DCASCADE_futuresim contains the script_DCASCADEBega_futuresim, with the code used to generate future hydrological scenarios, as well as the future sediment (disc)connectivity trajectories in D-CASCADE;, and the function DCASCADEmodel_Bega_future, an alternative version of the D-CASCADE model specifically tailored to simulate future sediment (dis)connectivity trajectories in the Bega river network To do so, it requires the outputs of a previous D-CASCADE historic simulation as a baseline;
- Folder supporting_functions contain all supporting functions and plot functions used in the code. Description of the functions purpose and functioning are provided as comments to the code.
