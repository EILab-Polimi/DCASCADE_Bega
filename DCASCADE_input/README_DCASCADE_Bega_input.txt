README DCASCADE_Bega_inputThe workspace DCASCADE_Bega_input contains:
- depth_hist, a matrix in each row reporting the year, discharge and water depth of the major flood events in the Bega river network. The discharge values refers to the Morans Crossing section, while water depth refers to the Bega Township gauging station. Discharge before 1940 is generated via depth/discharge correlation described in the supporting informations S1 in the paper. Discharge after 1940 is measured in the field. Not all flood events after 1940 are correlated to a specific discharge;
- n_Man is a txn matrix containing the Manning's roughness dynamic parameter for each reach n in each timestep t used in the historic simulations;
- Q_ARR_reach is a nx7 matrix reporting the discharge values for each reach relative the the flood classes with 1- 2- 5- 10- 20- 50- 100-year return period, estimated with the ARR model in Fryirs and Brierley (2001);
- Q_future_scenario is a 100x1 cell struct containing the 100 randomly-generated future discharge scenarios used in the future trajectories simulations;
- Q_Moran_18002020_flood contains the flood discharge referred to the Morans crossing gauging station from 1800 to 2020 (including 50 timesteps of Q1 for the initialisation) already reconstructed using height/discharge correlations;
- Q_Moran_4420 contains the daily discharge dataset from the Morans crossing gauging station from 1944 to 2020, used to derive flood frequency;
- reach_compact_group is a cell struct containing the IDs of the reaches which are compacted to display the results in Figure 5, 6 and 7 in the paper;
- ReachData is the main D-CASCADE input. It's a n x 1 Struct defining the features of the n network reaches. The network features refers to pre-ES conditions;
- SedDelRt_field contains the reach ID and the corresponding sediment delivery ratio as reported in Fryirs and Brierley (2001);
- Width_change is a 3xn matrix which contains the change in channel width in each reach in each of the 3 temporal phases where width change is expected, compared to the channel width reported in ReachData. Change can be both user-modified as in Phase 2 and driver by the channel expansion-add on as in Phase 1 and 3.
